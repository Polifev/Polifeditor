# Polifeditor (temporary name)

## Introduction

Polifeditor aims to be a simple tool for editing text files. It's primarily intended to be used for coding on headless systems. The initial goal was to be able to code on quite old laptop that will be a lot faster without any GUI OS.

The long-term objective is to have a light but functionnal developpement environment (directory-level browsing, syntax colouring, error-detection, autocompletion)
